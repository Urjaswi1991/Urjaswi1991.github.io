  <h2>🎓 Student Feedback Highlights</h2>

  <div class="feedback-grid">
    <div class="feedback-card">
      Professor Mukherjee did an exceptional job in providing lectures and other resources to help us succeed.
      I did one of the best jobs in an economics class because of her specifically.
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-card">
      Instructor is very knowledgeable in the material, stuck to the syllabus, and good on implying examples to the material being taught.
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-card">
      The course would normally be a more difficult course regarding mathematics and utilizing formulas. As a whole, the course taught me important subjects that I would need to utilize in the future if I continued with a future in Finance. With Professor Mukherjee, she only had strengths for this course that allowed us to succeed and I wouldn’t say there would be any need for improvement.
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-card">
      She did amazing, I really enjoyed her class would take her as a professor again.
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-card">
      I think she is a great teacher. She’s smart. She’s very knowledgeable. She’s understanding, she’s willing to work with you and help you.
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-card">
      I really appreciated having the concepts broken down slowly for me. I also really appreciated our professor checking in on the class and asking how we were feeling after she taught something difficult. Everything was explained well and she would take the time to draw out concepts for us so we could understand more in depth. I genuinely enjoyed this class.
    </div>

    <div class="feedback-card">
      I love how professor Mukherjee was very straight to the point and wouldn’t confuse the class.
